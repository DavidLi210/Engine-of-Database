/* complie
javac DavisBase.java or create new project in IDE like Eclipse or Intellji put the source code into the new Project.

/* it should result in 4 class file: DavisBase / Table/ Page/ Buffer

/* run
java DavisBase

Notice:
1.String, Date, and DateTime value should be wrap by Single Quotation Marks ‘ ‘.
2.When you execute the function of update , you should search particular tuple by row_id rather than other attributes.
3.Because when you first run it, it will create a "data" folder on the local directory. So make sure there is no file named "data" in the same directory.
Thanks!
